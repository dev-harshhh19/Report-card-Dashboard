## Installation Steps  

### 1. Clone the Repository  
Use the following commands to clone the project and navigate to the project folder:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dev-harshhh19/Report-card-Dashboard
cd Report-card-Dashboard
```  

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)  
A virtual environment helps isolate project dependencies.  
```bash
python -m venv venv  
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac  
venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows  
```  

### 3. Set Up Database Configuration
Configure your PostgreSQL database connection:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env file with your NeonDB connection string
```

Update the `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env` file with your actual NeonDB connection string.

### 4. Install Required Dependencies  
Install all necessary Python libraries using the `requirements.txt` file:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```  

### 5. Run the Application  
Start the application by running the main file:  
```bash
python Report-card-Dashboard.py
```
